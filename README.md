# Semi-Automatic Stronghold Finder (W/ GUI)

![Preview_Software](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52530661/111217603-077c1500-85d6-11eb-8b38-c612af174a4c.jpg)

The software provides multiple different functionalities that help the user in finding the stronghold in the videogame Minecraft. 
The tool allows the user to:
* Choose what game window to use. Remember that the name is different/changes depending on what game mode you are using and if there is a new update out.
* Bind custom hotkeys that will be used to get the user's current position and view angle.
* Graph will showcase the stronghold rings, the estimated stronghold position, and the total distance from the user's current position (in blocks).
* Option to enable automatic update of the user's position on the graph, with custom choice of interval (standard 10 sec). This also includes a reference line that helps the user know that they are heading in the right direction.
* Option to customize X, Y, Width, and Height used by selenium to read the coordinates and angle. This also includes the functionality to update and read what's on-screen in real-time (so you know the inputted values are correct and selenium reads the correct numbers). Keep in mind, to change these values, you will need to check the "MODIFY" checkbox in the right top corner, and you will need to press "save" to save these for the next time). The "switch" button allows switching between values in pixels or in percentage (in reference to the game window dimension). 
* Everything is saved to an XML-file, so you don't need to repeat the steps each time you start the program.

A heads up: To my understanding, these kinds of software aren't allowed in genuine speedrunning attempts.
